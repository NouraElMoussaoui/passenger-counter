# Counter Application

This is a simple counter application built with JavaScript. The application allows users to increment a count and save the current count.

## Features

- **Increment:** The `increment` function increases the count by 1 each time it is called. The updated count is then displayed on the screen.
- **Save:** The `save` function saves the current count followed by a dash and then resets the count to 0. The saved counts are displayed on the screen.

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Click the "Increment" button to increase the count.
3. Click the "Save" button to save the current count and reset the counter.

## Code Overview

The application uses basic JavaScript functions and DOM manipulation. The count is stored in a variable, and the `document.getElementById` method is used to display the count on the screen.

## Future Improvements

Future updates may include the ability to decrement the count, delete saved counts, and more.
